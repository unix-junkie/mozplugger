See the file COPYING for more information.

Use the standard GNU sequence of
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Use './configure --help' to view possible options

Notes:
        * You will need X-libs development pacakge installed so that
        the build can find the appropriate include files.

To install in your own directory: (for Mozilla/Firefox)
	make localinstall_mozilla

To install in your own directory: (for Netscape)
	make localinstall_netscape

To install in your own directory: (for Opera)
	make localinstall_opera

To install globally:
	make install

By default, the plugin is installed in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/

On some systems, the plugin directory may be elsewhere, for example
   /usr/lib/netscape/plugins
   /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
   $MOZILLA_HOME/plugins

If you find that your browser fails to detect the plugin, you need
to place place a symbolic link in your paricular plugin directory
that points to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mozplugger.so. I believe
this is the case for Ubuntu where firefox looks
in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins

If you don't want to put mozpluggerrc in /etc/ you can put it in one of:
   $MOZPLUGGER_HOME/
   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mozplugger/
   $HOME/.config/mozplugger/
   $HOME/.mozplugger/
   $HOME/.netscape/
   $HOME/.mozilla/
   $HOME/.opera/
   $MOZILLA_HOME/
   $OPERA_HOME/
   /usr/local/netscape/
   /etc/
   /usr/local/mozilla/
   /usr/local/netscape/

You might also want to customize your 'mozpluggerrc' file before installing it.

You must run mozplugger-update after every change to mozpluggerrc or when you
install / remove applications referenced in mozpluggerc

In case of problem with this version, submit a bug report on
http://mozplugger.mozdev.org describing your problem, your system and
an URL which causes the problem if possible.
