As of Feb 2011, the distrubtion includes configure.ac and Makefile.in.
Eventually the standard GNU ./configure && make && make install 
mechanism will supercede the previous Makefile.

For advantageous users (i.e. this will overwrite the Makefile) 
to compile do the following:

1/ 'cp Makefile Makefile.old'
2/ 'autoconf'
3/ 'chmod +x configure'
4/ './configure --help' to view possible options
5/ './configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc' for same behaviour as before
6/ 'make xx' as before...

If this fails report bug and do the following
1/ 'cp Makefile.old Makefile'



To re-compile:
	If necessary, edit Makefile to suit to your system.
	Type 'make xx'. Where xx = the platform and/or type
        of build you want.
        e.g. 
        1/ 'make linux' - builds for linux
        2/ 'make linux BUILD=DEBUG' - builds debug version for linux
        3/ 'make linux libprefix=/lib64' - builds and links against the
                                         for 64bit libraries 

        If you just type 'make' it should list the options available
Notes:
        * You will need X-libs development pacakge installed so that
        the build can find the appropriate include files.

To install in your own directory: (for Mozilla/Firefox)
	make localinstall_mozilla

To install in your own directory: (for Netscape)
	make localinstall_netscape

To install in your own directory: (for Opera)
	make localinstall_opera

To install globally:
	make install
or:	
	make install prefix=/usr/local
or:
	make install libprefix=/lib64

By default, the plugin is installed in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/

On some systems, the plugin directory may be elsewhere, for example
   /usr/lib/netscape/plugins
   /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
   $MOZILLA_HOME/plugins

If you find that your browser fails to detect the plugin, you need
to place place a symbolic link in your paricular plugin directory
that points to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mozplugger.so. I believe
this is the case for Ubuntu where firefox looks
in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins

If you don't want to put mozpluggerrc in /etc/ you can put it in one of:
   $MOZPLUGGER_HOME/
   $HOME/.mozplugger/
   $HOME/.netscape/
   $HOME/.mozilla/
   $HOME/.opera/
   $MOZILLA_HOME/
   $OPERA_HOME/
   /usr/local/netscape/
   /etc/
   /usr/local/mozilla/
   /usr/local/netscape/

You might also want to customize your 'mozpluggerrc' file before installing it.

In case of problem with this version, submit a bug report on
http://mozplugger.mozdev.org describing your problem, your system and
an URL which causes the problem if possible.
