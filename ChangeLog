       Tidy-up - removed the repeated open display close display when 
       repeats > 1.
       First withdraw window before reparenting. This makes it more robust
       as mozplugger is no longer fighting with the window manager. This
       fixes. Mozdev bug #22440.

       * mozplugger-child.c:
       Remove duplication of code by moving common child (app) handling
       code to a common file "mozplugger-child.c".

2010-01-24 release 1.13.1
        * npapi :
	Updated to version 23 from the mozilla SDK. Not an exact copy but
	merge in of changes from mozilla SDK into mozplugger.

        * mozplugger-helper.c :
        Changed code to look for victim and reparent in a different way
	part of attempt to fix NX bug - using NX in particular 
	configuration it was found that the swallow flag didnt work.

	* mozplugger.c :
	Added patch from Zhao for allowing mozplugger to work with
	QT/Webkit based browsers.
        Mozdev bug #22065

2009-08-22 release 1.13.0
	* mozpluggerrc :
	Removed the outdated test for acroread version this avoids the
	misleading message about "sh: acroread: command not found" that
	appears on stderr. Mozdev bug #21144

	* mozpluggerrc :
	Removed the incorrect test to see if mplayer supports vorbis. The
	user should edit mozpluggerrc to include or exclude mplayer based
	on what codecs that have compiled in or out of mplayer.
	Mozdev bug #21119

        * mozplugger.c :
	Removed unecessary calls to exit() in mozplugger.c plus spotted
	fixed segmentation fault. Mozdev bug #21118

        * mozplugger.c, mozpluggerrc:
	Fixed limit on number of handlers, mime types and commands. Instead
	there is now one limit which is on the amount of static memory
	allocated. Mozdev bug #21117

	* mozplugger-helper.c:
	Added ability to expand the winname used in swallow to include the
	$file variable. This allows to capture those windows that take the
	name of the file they are displaying. Thanks to Przemek Króliszewski
	for providing the idea and intial patch. Mozdev bug #21071.

	* mozplugger.c, npunix.c, npapi.h & npupp.h:
	Bring API up to date by adding in missing functions. The API version
	is now 0.22. Note, no new functionality added yet. Also switched
	over to using nptypes.h which defines things like uint32_t etc.

2009-04-16 release 1.12.1
	* mozplugger-helper.c, mozplugger-linker.c, mozplugger-controller.c:
	Removed select timeout to avoid CPU wakeups, add signal handler & pipe
	to monitor when the child process dies (as opposed to a polling loop)
	Mozdev bug #20662

	* mozplugger-helper.c, mozpluggerrc:
	When starting a second instance of evince, the second process will die
	and hand over control to the first process. This causes
	mozplugger-helper to fail to swallow the window as it thinks evince
	has died. Solution is to set the exits flag in mozpluggerrc and
	alter the code to allow for both exits & swallow flags to be set at
	the same time.  Mozdev bug #20686
    
	* npapi:
	Removed the obsolote JRI code. That is removal of the jri* header
	files, the include of those header files in npapi.h, etc and the
	removal of the NPN_GetJavaClass call from mozplugger.

	Applied patch to provide support for okular (KDE 4).
	Mozdev bug #20114 (Laurent Leonard)
  
        * mozplugger,c, mozplugger.7, mozpluggerrc:
	Added the enviroment variable $fragment so that the trailing 
	fragment (the bit after the #) can be passed to the application
	if so required. Updated mozpluggerrc with changes provided
	by Walter Neumann to use the $fragment for acroread. 
	Mozdev bug #20087 (Peter Leese & Walter Neumann)

	* mozplugger-helper.c:
	Fix the problem that mozplugger always picks the command with stream
	flag set even if it is lower down the list of commands. Really
	mozplugger should test each in order. 
	Mozdev bug #20079

2008-09-12 release 1.11.0

	* mozplugger-helper.c:
	For gv, always call XMoveResizeWindow in adjust_window_size(),
	even when the target size has not changed. (Louis Bavoil)
	
        * mozplugger.c, mozplugger-linker.c:
	Added the functionality that if autostart=0 and the application doesnt
	handle autostart=0 that the linker will be used instead.

        * mozplugger-linker.c:
	Add new binary to handle the QT link special case that was previously
	done by the controller. (Peter Leese)

        * mozplugger-helper.c:
	Added patch from Ari Pollak to fix failure to swallow mozdev

	(Peter Leese)

        * npapi.h, npupp.h, npunix.c:

	Added fix for Mozdev bug #18943. (Ville Skytta)

	* mozplugger.c, mozplugger-common.c, mozplugger-helper.c, mozplugger.h:
	Tidy up - Moved include files out of mozplugger.h into various source
	files and deleted unnecessary ones. (Peter Leese)
	Corrected minor error where controller application incorrectly had the
	helper name (as see wehn using ps command).

	* mozplugger.c:
	Added call to safeURL for mms URLs. (Peter Leese)

	* mozplugger.c, mozplugger-common.c, mozplugger.h:
	Code modified so that location of mozdebug file shown in the
	about:plugins page is always correct. (Peter Leese)

	* mozplugger-helper.c, mozplugger.c, mozplugger.7:
	Code modfied not to use controls if mozilla passed null as the window 
	to draw controls in. Updated man page to warn user of this possible
	situaton. Some debug messages were also changed so as  not generate 
	error messages but more friendly debug messages when this null window
	event occurs.
	- fix for Mozdev bug #18837 (Peter Leese)

2008-03-22 release 1.10.2

	* mozplugger-controller.c:
	If mozpluggerrc command contains both the controls flag and $window
	macro, the old behaviour was a bit odd. This has been changed to
	instead put a small controller widget in top left corner of the
	window. This allows controls to still work and also it only
	obscures a small part of the window. (Peter Leese)

	* mozplugger.7:
	Added reference to <OBJECT> (as well as <EMBED>) to man page
	(Peter Leese)

	* mozplugger.c:

	use mplayer -playlist $file. (Peter Leese)
	This fixes Mozdev bug #10244

	clickable link (Peter Leese) [Mozdev bug #18105]

	* mozplugger-helper.c:
	Removed launching of mozplugger-controller from helper, now launched
	directly from mozplugger.c hence no mozplugger-helper process is 
	created (halving the number of processes running) (Peter Leese)
	[Mozdev bug #17775]

	"controls" no longer use "swallow" mechanism (Peter Leese)

	Major code cleanup.
	
	* mozplugger-common.c: New file created.

	* mozplugger-helper.c, mozplugger.c: Added the flag "event_swallow"
	to use an alternative event driven code. (Eric Kerin)

	* mozplugger.c: In some conditions, MozPlugger now uses the href
	field of embed tags. (Rafael Santiago)
	
	* mozplugger.c: The memory of an instance was not freed when the
	instance was destroyed.

	* mozplugger.c: Some embeded applications were not killed when
	leaving a page.
	
	* mozplugger.c: For some files, Mozilla did not give the right
	MIME type to Mozplugger when creating a new stream. Mozplugger

	* mozplugger.c: Embeded files with loop=0 were not played.
	
	* mozplugger.c: The files begining with a / were not accepted.

2003-06-14 version 1.2.1
	
	* mozplugger-helper.c: The swallow feature did not work on some
	computers. Mozplugger now scans potential victim windows faster.
	It takes a little more CPU in the initialization of the swallow
	but it is more accurate.

	* mozplugger-helper.c: Mozplugger swallows the most recently opened
        instance of a window, not the first found. (Bernard Blackham)

2003-03-14 version 1.1.2

	created for each loaded plugin, until Mozilla exits.
